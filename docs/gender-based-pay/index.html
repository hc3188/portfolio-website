                        <p>Open City Data reveals that over the past six years men have been paid on average $14,000 a year more than women. Looking at payments on a yearly basis reveals the wage gap has held steady at roughly $14,000 each year over that time. A breakdown of the top 10 most popular jobs in government shows more women than men in those jobs over that time period, suggesting that men may comprise an inordinate amount of higher paying jobs (that being said, it’s a pretty even split for the 10 highest paying jobs in the government). When looking at jobs paying over $80,000 on a yearly basis, the data reveals the gap has grown since 2014: men outnumbered women in high paying jobs by 4,000 in 2014 and 7,000 in 2020. However, that is down from a peak of 13,000 in 2017.  Further investigation will be required before drawing conclusions. For that, I will have to call people within city government and academics, most likely at community colleges, who can speak to the structure of city government and the situation in NYC.</p>

<p>By running the first names of city employees through a gender_guesser module, I was able to determine, to the best of the module’s ability, the gender for the vast majority of city employees. It may be better to use the word sex than gender, but I used gender to stay consistent with the name of the module. Of course, knowing a person’s gender is impossible without speaking to them. Running names through the module and calculating mean pay over six years revealed that men earn $14,000 more than women on a yearly basis. An analysis of several of the most populated jobs did not reveal a significant wage gap between sex, except for per session teachers, for which it appears men were paid $1,700 more per session than women.</p>

<p>A breakdown of the 10 most populated jobs in city government reveal more women than men in those jobs. That suggests the wage gap lies in having more men in higher paying jobs than women. In fact, the city government has been quicker to hire men for jobs paying over $80,000, although recently more women have been joining their ranks.</p>
