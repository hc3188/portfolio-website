                    <p class="credit super-font">By Harrison Connery</p>
                    <div class="sub-font body-text">
                        <p>Five months into the pandemic, Ted and Chelsea Cavanaugh had enough of doing their at-home workouts squeezed into either side of their bed in their 900-square-foot apartment.</p>
<p>They just needed more space.</p>
<p>Even though their elderly Italian landlords had always been kind to them and they loved their apartment so much they undertook several renovations during their 10 year stay, they took the money they were able to generate during the pandemic as food photographers and purchased a home, like they had always envisioned, despite the cost.</p>
<p>“Sitting alone for a while makes you realize I need to do something besides sit here forever,” Cavanaugh said.</p>
<p>In late summer  2020 the couple were able to find a four bedroom townhouse in Bay Ridge with a backyard and finished basement for $1.15 million, though it came at a 30% increase over the house’s previous sale a year ago.</p>
<p>“There’s basically no haggle,” Cavanaugh said. “It was definitely more than we wanted to pay but it is what it is.”</p>
<p>The Cavanaughs’ experience purchasing a home during the Covid-19 pandemic is indicative of a larger trend across New York City: the housing market, briefly disrupted by the coronavirus, is proving more resilient than many prognosticators thought last spring, as residents fled the densely packed city by the thousands in fear of the airborne virus.</p>
<p>The once-in-a-century pandemic hit households’ largest investment differently neighborhood by neighborhood depending on the area’s population density, amenities and median income; but by and large, prices have bounced back across the city after notable drops across most areas in 2020.</p>
<p>The recovery has been slowest in Manhattan, where many neighborhoods have failed to reach 35 sales that achieved the benchmark the previous two years. However, prices have risen in a handful of neighborhoods. In the outer boroughs like Queens and Brooklyn, borough-wide medians never fell at all, though the number of sales fell significantly last year. This year, the number of home sales, which some experts say is a better indicator of the market’s strength, are also on the rise.</p>
<p>Data on more than 40,000 home sales from 2019 through mid 2021 reveals that the typical house or condominium is selling for more this year than last in a majority of neighborhoods with enough home sales to be analyzed.</p>
<p>The trends vary considerably from neighborhood to neighborhood, as prices that dropped in a smattering of neighborhoods have continued going down this year. But the analysis found that the year-over-year quarter two median home price is up in each of the city’s five boroughs.</p>

<p>Bridget Applegate, the licensed associate real estate broker at Corcoran who sold the Cavanaugh’s their home in Bay Ridge, experienced the market’s dramatic fluctuations firsthand over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>“It was one of the most phrenetic times we’d ever seen in the marketplace from the moment we opened in June [2020] to, really, now,” Applegate said.</p>
<p>She said the Brooklyn market was bolstered by Manhattanites who suddenly wanted to escape the crowded elevators and lobbies of their high rises for the relative spaciousness of Brooklyn, where they could live in a small, four to eight unit building, or purchase their own home, which might even have a backyard, for the same price as their current living situation.</p>
<p>“We saw a huge influx of buyers from the Upper West Side and Upper East Side and other places of Manhattan coming into Brooklyn for the first time,” Applegate said.</p>

<p>In Queens, prices are up year-over-year in 11 neighborhoods and down in only three with enough sales to analyze. The median house price across all neighborhoods is up from $670,000 to $765,000, or 16%, from last summer. Prices jumped in neighborhoods across the socioeconomic spectrum: in Queens Village and Hollis, they jumped by over 20% from quarter two of last year, while sales remained strong in Bayside and Astoria, where prices are up 6% and 15%, respectively.</p>

<p>In Manhattan, the most expensive borough and the only one to see the overall price of homes fall during 2020, prices climbed in five neighborhoods but decreased in six, and five other neighborhoods failed to reach the number of sales necessary for analysis.However, the recovery has been strong in the Financial District and Murray Hill, where year-over-year quarter two prices climbed by 38% and 22%, respectively. Those neighborhoods saw median price decreases of 15% and 2%, respectively, in 2020.</p>
<p>The 2021 rebound followed a year when fear of infection spread as rampantly through New York’s densely populated boroughs as the virus itself. Those able to work remotely, primarily in Manhattan, fled the city, causing the price of homes to depreciate 2.8% from the end of 2019. In Brooklyn and Queens, prices rose in spite of the coronavirus, by just under 6% and 3%, respectively.</p>
<p>In a similar display of the extreme fluctuation, homes in the Upper West Side from 59 street - 79 street rose by 22%, as 2020 year-over-year prices in the Financial and Murray Hill fell. This year,  the Upper West Side has seen prices fall by 30%, even as they recover in Flatiron and Murray Hill.</p>
<p>The flip-flopping pattern came as prognosticators were too quick to declare the death of the city, said Jonathan J. Miller, president and CEO of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal and consulting company.</p>
<p>“It was sort of preposterous and not very forward thinking,” Miller said. “The data shows bidding war activity has doubled over the last year.”</p>
<p>Miller categorizes home sales that sold over the asking price as the product of a bidding war, which he said account for about 6% of sales this year, though it’s still a long way away from the 15% peak in 2015.</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors is also optimistic about the city’s outlook.</p>
<p>“There’s going to always be a demand for city centers,” said Dr. Jessica Lautz, who added that it’s not just younger buyers who are interested in living in big cities. “There has been a demand for extended families, grandparents, the nuclear family unit, to live together. Wherever younger buyers are going I would say baby boomer parents could soon be in tow.”</p>
<p>Lautz said any kind of blip in the market is likely a temporary trend so long as supply remains as limited as it has been nationally.</p>
<p>“We saw a record increase on an annualized basis on home prices and that's driven by a lack of housing inventory and the high demand of housing right now. In the last year supply has been increasingly tight and there are a lot of buyers,” Lautz said.</p>
<p>Miller contends that last year’s slow market, while worsened by Covid, may not have been caused by it. Instead, he points to two recent pieces of legislation that hurt the value of expensive homes. The first, the Trump administration’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which capped federal tax deductions for state and local tax payments, known as SALT, at $10,000. The second, New York City’s so-called “Mansion Tax”, is a law enacted in 2018 that incrementally raises the sales tax on homes in New York City worth over $2 million.</p>
<p>“Higher taxes cause values to decline and so from 2018 through the end of 2019, housing prices in Manhattan in aggregate fell about 15%,” he said. “So the question is: is your lower housing prices specifically because of Covid, or is it part of the downward trajectory that was interrupted by Covid because of these taxes that really impacted pricing, not just in Manhattan or New York City, but in the suburbs as well.”</p>
<p>High end real estate aside, the initial drop and subsequent improvement of home prices followed a long period of prosperity for the city when crime was down, income was up, new residents were coming in and home prices and rents were up across most parts of the city. Even the much-maligned Metropolitan Transportation Authority was projecting a profit that would allow it to undertake a massive overhaul of its aging infrastructure. But the pandemic changed all that.</p>
<p>Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx all saw similar overall home value fluctuations, with homes appreciating by 2.6%-2.8% in each borough. Queens was the only borough in which more money was spent in 2020 than in 2019, though the number of sales fell by 4,000. Astoria and Jamaica Estates ended the year as the borough’s most expensive neighborhoods, but Arverne, Woodside, Corona and Sunnyside saw the greatest home value appreciations, with Arverne and Woodside leading the way at 36% and 25%, respectively, and the final two seeing median appreciations of 20%.</p>
<p>Brooklyn boasted the most resilient overall market, with homes across the borough appreciating by just under 6%. Like in Manhattan, homeowners and buyers in different neighborhoods had wildly different experiences. The value of homes in Lefferts Garden grew by almost 80% even as sales fell by roughly 50%. The Fulton Mall area also reported strong growth and healthy sales: sales there increased in value by just under 70% year-over-year.</p>
<p>But homeowners in East Williamsburg saw the median home value fall below $1 million, as homes there lost 38% of their value year-over-year and roughly half their value from their peak of $1.8 million in quarter one of 2020. To the South, Carroll Gardens was also hit hard by the pandemic, with homes there depreciating by 34%.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods ringing Brooklyn’s outer edge from Bay Ridge to Canarsie were all popular destinations late last year. In Gravesend, an 1,100-square-foot home at 239 Avenue P, featuring  a small patch of grass in the front and a garage in the back, sold for just under $1 million, up $32,000 from its last sale the year before.</p>
<p>Last year in Canarsie, a 954-square-foot, two bedroom, single story house next to a laundromat sold for $561,000, a 28% increase over its previous sale in 2019.</p>
<p>In Bay Ridge a two-family home with a wrought-iron gated entryway and brick facade sold for $290,000 more in 2020 than in 2019.</p>
<p>The rising prices, even during a time of pandemic, explains why Cavanaugh feels like he got a bargain on his townhouse, given that the previous owner undertook a gut renovation. On a recent Saturday afternoon, he pulled up an active listing for a neighboring house on his computer, to show off the million dollar asking price despite the old wood panel kitchen cabinets and antiquated dishwasher.</p>
<p>“There’s new electrical, the kitchen’s brand new, everything is basically brand new,” Cavanaugh said. “</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he did pay 30% more than the previous owner, despite the two sales occurring roughly a year apart. But  the Cavanaughs are content with having not only doubled the amount of indoor space they have, but also gaining a backyard, cooled in the hot summer months by a frequent sea breeze blowing East from the Upper Bay.</p>
<p>“One of the things I like the most is being able to grill,” Cavanaugh said. “It’s a rare luxury, we grilled burgers last night, it’s nice just to switch it up.”</p>
<p>Pamela S. Hannigan, assistant professor at NYU’s Shack Institute of Real Estate, said buyers consider neighborhoods holistically before buying a house, which is why values in some areas, like Brooklyn and Queens, are recovering more quickly than others.</p>
<p>“Real estate values capitalize all locational advantages like transportation, environment (including green space, revitalization and sanitation) and ‘amenities’ like restaurants and recreation,” Hannigan said.  “This varies significantly across NYC neighborhoods apart from the overall market.”</p>
<p>Additionally, interest rates remain at historic lows, which means that, combined with federal stimulus money to help keep the economy afloat through the pandemic, those who can afford to buy are incentivized to do so -- and soon.</p>
<p>“Neighborhoods that were hot before Covid like the Meatpacking District, West Chelsea and Lincoln Center West are getting premiums again, exacerbated by very low rates,” Hannigan said. “What this will mean when the Fed starts to taper is unclear and many analysts are worried about a negative turn, perhaps starting in the fall.”</p>
<p>Applegate said she expects rates to rise this year.</p>
<p>“I feel like things are gonna go back to a really breakneck pace again this fall,” she said. “And I think the only thing that’s gonna slow it down is gonna be rising interest rates which I think are imminent, they have to come. We’ve had historically low interest rates for a long time.”</p>
<p>One more shadow looms for the city’s real estate market besides a potential hike in rates: the number of people working remotely who will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Miller said before the pandemic, roughly 5% of employees worked 100% remotely, a figure which projects to double or triple after the pandemic. More hybrid workers could depress the market if midtown workers decide to brave a longer, but less frequent, commute, although Miller was quick to point out that greater flexibility could encourage some people to move into the city.</p>
<p>“So you’re talking 10-15%, not 80%,” Miller said. “It’s the next 50% of that cohort that is likely morphing into a hybrid employee, and that’s what’s up in the air at the moment.”</p>
