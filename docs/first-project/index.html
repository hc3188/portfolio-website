                        <p>As Americans smoke less and less, the extent to which tobacco taxes contribute to the trend is becoming harder to measure.</p>
<p>The American Lung Association, the nation’s leading anti-smoking group, continues to push for higher cigarette taxes in some states.</p>
<p>But some epidemiologists say not enough is being done to discourage smoking among certain demographic groups where smoking is more common in spite of previous tax increases.</p>
<p>In New York City, health officials were pleased when the smoking rate fell to its lowest rate ever last year, but it’s not clear how much of the change was due to a 2017 anti-smoking campaign, which included a tax increase, and how much was due to demographic changes in the city.</p>
<p>“More New Yorkers than ever have extinguished their smoking habit – or never even picked it up – and we’re all healthier for it,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Dave A. Chokshi last December.</p>
<p>If tobacco taxes remain effective, the smoking rate would fall by even more, said Raymond Niaura, interim chairman of the Department of Epidemiology at New York University.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to wonder whether [tobacco taxes] kind of reached the limit of their effectiveness, because we still have a huge chunk of the population still smoking,” said Niaura.</p>
<p>That chunk is disproportionately poor and lower-educated, and the smoking rate may be falling due as much to gentrification as any policy.</p>

<p>National smoking rates have been plummeting for decades: more than 40% of adults smoked in the 1960s, compared to roughly 15% in 2018, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Lung Association. In 1998, attorneys general from 46 states won a landmark action against tobacco companies, known as the Master Settlement Agreement, that forced big tobacco to pay in perpetuity for the public harm caused by tobacco products, with the first $206 billion to be paid over 25 years, according to a 2001 report from the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p>“The way the government was successful in that action was basically arguing that the tobacco companies have to pay for the health consequences of their cigarettes,” Niaura said. “But if you look at how that money was actually spent, most of it went into state general funds and they ended up fixing roads and doing other stuff.”</p>
<p>By 2001, New York state was already diverting settlement money away from healthcare. That year, it put 37% of the payments it received into a rainy day fund. New York City used its early revenue to fund capital projects, including the construction of new schools. In 2020, New York state received over $1.9 billion in revenue from settlement payments and tobacco taxes, and allocated under $40 million to prevention programs, according to the Truth Initiative, an anti-smoking advocacy group. That’s 20% of what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the state spend.</p>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/5973364"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Other states allocated even less money to smoking prevention and cessation. Rhode Island committed the entirety of its first $685 million to float a loan to balance its budget in 2002, according to a 2017 report from the state Office of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>“There’s somewhat of a symbiotic relationship between tobacco companies and governments, because governments know if we need some more quick revenue we can raise tobacco taxes, and not only do we get the revenue, but we look like the good guys,” Niaura said. “And because people are addicted to cigarettes, prices are not very elastic and that’s why you have people who are willing to spend exorbitant amounts of money to maintain their habit.”</p>
<p>That leaves smokers addicted to cigarettes in an awkward position: on the one hand, cigarettes are very expensive; on the other, they have limited resources to quit and a pack of cigarettes isn’t prohibitively expensive. Experts say the situation isn’t likely to change in the near future.</p>
<p>“States and the federal government are as addicted to the tax as individuals are to the nicotine,” said David Abrams, professor of social and behavioral sciences at NYU. “They don’t really want too many people to quit because the tax revenue will go down dramatically.”</p>
<p>Trevor Summerfield, director of advocacy for New York, Vermont and Massachusetts for the American Lung Association, said his organization lobbied unsuccessfully for a $1 tax increase on cigarettes at the state level last year, even though the ALA projects doing so would raise tax revenue by $39 million.</p>
<p>“There were other priorities this legislative session than a cigarette tax,” Summerfield said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ALA estimates that over 22,000 New Yorkers die each year from smoking, a figure it places at 480,000 nationally. Most of those people are at or below the poverty level: the CDC reports the smoking rate for those below the poverty level is twice that of adults who earn twice the poverty level.</p>
<p>“It has to do with the issue of health being more salient to people who have the means to do something about their own health,” said Niaura.</p>
<p>The heaviest smokers tend to be people with severe mental illness, because smoking can temporarily relieve symptoms of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, according to Mental Health America.</p>
<p>Abrams said the general public might have fatigue from years of anti-tobacco campaigning.</p>
<p>“Talking about the fact that half a million die prematurely every year and could be prevented; if you talk about that for 20 years, after 5 or 6 years people are like, ok, so what’s new? It becomes a part of the background and therefore it’s not as tragic,” he said. “The background deaths are the background deaths.”</p>
